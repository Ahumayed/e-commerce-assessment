# Project Diary
To help better express my train of thought while developing this project I will update this diary as I go along. I will also try to keep it in chronological order.

## Day 1
Before starting the project I skimmed through NestJS documentation to refresh my knowledge, and make sure I have a general idea of the project architecture and plan based on the requirements.

My approach is usually by just making something "work" and then iterate on it to make it better. So please don't mind any weird code or bad practices initially :)
